# UE4-Manager-for-Linux
 This is an unofficial manager for the Unreal Engine 4 for GNU/Linux 

Install:
On Debian, Ubuntu, etc you can simply install the .deb package as normal. (Epic Games recommends Ubuntu 16.04 (64 Bit) or newer for the Unreal Engine 4)

On other distros you can execute the UE4_Manager.py in the source folder with python3. Take a look at the dependencies.txt file in the source folder and install the packages you haven't already.
